This is a specialized adaptation of the Adaptive Learning System for learners of Esperanto.

**What is special about this edition:**

- A concrete example of how the system works with sources and human languages

## External Sources

All lessons in this subject rely ONLY on:

1. **`sources/grammar.txt`** – Esperanto grammar reference  
2. **`sources/dictionary.txt`** – Authorized word list with translations and basic forms  

This ensures that all learners and all AI feedback use the same, verifiable sources.
